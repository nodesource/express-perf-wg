# Performance Working Group Meeting Notes – 2025-08-06

### Meta Information

- GitHub Issue: [#38](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/38)

### Discussions at the Meeting

- **[@groophylifefor](https://github.com/groophylifefor) presented CI-based benchmarking tooling** for performance testing:
  - Since this approach was presented in before meeting, this presentation is a summarizing for [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd)

- **Discussion on benchmarking noise and CI reliability**:
  - [@UlisesGascon](https://github.com/UlisesGascon) offered to test the Docker-based approach in a more stable **NodeSource infra environment** to avoid GitHub runner inconsistencies
  - [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) and [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) discussed noisy neighbor issues and how 5–7% performance noise can skew CI results
  - Reference to Hacker News article about CI benchmarking noise (Link in resources as Benchmarks in CI)

- **Suggested next steps**:
  - Submit a **PR** integrating the tooling into the WG repository for easier review and inline code discussions
  - Define **JSON schema** for result output to support future dashboard integration [#19](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/19)
  - Add **NPM overrides** support for testing candidate patches against baseline
  - Need **memory and CPU monitoring** in addition to latency/throughput metrics

- **Public Benchmarks** [#21](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/21):
  - Deprioritized for now unless someone volunteers to maintain them
  - [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) suggested offering guidance if a contributor emerges

- **WG Charter** [#3](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/3):
  - Consensus that the charter is in a good state
  - Champions for sub-initiatives can be assigned when needed as async work increases

- **Infra Coordination** [#5](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/5):
  - Kept open as a tracker for communicating infrastructure needs to Node.js Foundation and partners
  - [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) bring their Azure credits to the WG for infrastructure use, in addition to existing DigitalOcean credits.

- **Router Champion** [#11](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/11):
  - [@bjohansebas](https://github.com/bjohansebas) confirmed availability to champion the `router` package

- **Diagnostic Channels** [#29](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/29):
  - The group discussed whether to pursue **Node.js Diagnostic Channel API** support or explore **OpenTelemetry** integration instead
  - [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) emphasized the need to measure whether removing `debug` package improves performance (current debug hits code paths whether enabled or not)
  - [@edsadr](https://github.com/edsadr) noted diagnostic channels mainly used by Node.js core developers, suggested OpenTelemetry as more actionable for APMs
  - Discussion of replacing debug functionality with zero-cost diagnostic channels
  - **Looking for a champion** to lead this initiative

- **Windows Support** [#29]:
  - [@groophylifefor](https://github.com/groophylifefor) has working Windows support branch for Durant tooling but hasn't opened PR yet

- **Dashboard and Infrastructure Parallel Planning**:
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) proposed defining a shared **JSON schema** first to enable dashboard work in parallel with infrastructure setup
  - [@edsadr](https://github.com/edsadr) confirmed NodeSource can help provide both infrastructure and UI/dashboard support
  - NodeSource offers zero-instrumentation observability platform with sidecar that doesn't impact main thread
  - GitHub Actions workflows may trigger external infra or run within GitHub using containers
  - [@riosje](https://github.com/riosje) from NodeSource to create issue with specific infrastructure proposals

### Parallel Work Streams Identified

1. **JSON Schema Definition**  - for dashboard integration
2. **NodeSource Infrastructure Setup**  - external infra proposals  
3. **Container Approaches**  - multiple implementation flavors (local, GitHub Actions, external)
4. **PR Integration**  - bringing Murat's CI tooling into the main repo
